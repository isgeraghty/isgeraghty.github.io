        <p>About Montana's State website:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This state's website is also very straight forawrd. They seem to have  navigation tabs for anything anyone could be wondering about. There also seems to be a lot on  military stuff, since there is a high military presence in Montana. I will say that the website does seem a little more bland than the  other websites. Montana is also a very red Republican state. I don't want to be rough on it but it is my least favorite website. It just needs some more pictures and better colors. The colors just seem a little bland, and could be more vibrant. They also seem to, at least on home page, put a lot of emphasis on their senators and representatives. I feel like they should show more  on their home page, like hiking or outdoors things.</li>
