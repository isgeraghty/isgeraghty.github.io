        <p>About Nebraska's State website:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This state's website is also very easy to navigate. They also give a lot of facts on their home page. They also have a calander showing the upcoming events that people could go to. I also like on there page that they have a place to look for a job if sommeone needed one. I also like how  their website is trying to get more young people interested because they  make it very appealing with all their images and fancy graphics. Nebraska is also another red Republican state.</li>
