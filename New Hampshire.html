        <p>About New Hampshire's State website:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This states's website is very easy to navigate. They have navigation at the top with drop down menus to see all the things underneath that may help someone. However, this website, just like Monstana's, is very bland and needs a lot more images and vibrant colors. There is just not much appealing on the pages and if they had a lot more images then it would really help drawn the attention of the viewer and make them want to learn more, or visit. New Hampshire is a state that is neither red or blue, it is undecided.</li>
