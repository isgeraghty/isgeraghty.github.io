            Winter is the season of down coats, fuzzy hats and mittens, sitting next to the fire. making cookies, waiting for santa, and drinking cocoa. During winter many people still work and/or go to school but there are chances in some parts of the country that too much snow fall could change this. Snow falls throughout the season and for kids it is the most fun they may have all year.
