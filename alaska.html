        <p>About Alaska's State website:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This state's website seems very straight forward. I like how they have a background image to their navigation on their main page. Alaska is also a red state so, since I'm a Democrat, I myself am not a big fan of them. I also like how they make it for people who want to start a buisness or company, really easy with a link to all the forms they need to fill out. They seem very open and welcoming to everyone rather they are a visitor or a resident of Alaska.</li>
