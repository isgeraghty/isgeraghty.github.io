        <h1><a href="https://www.beatsbydre.com/" target="blank">The First Good Website (Beats By Dre)</a></h1>
        
        <p>
            The first good website that I chose to write about was the Beats by Dre website. It is a website that sells headphones and earbuds. They have been known for making some of the best noise cancelling headphones in the world. They  are at a litte bit of a high price, but being someone who owns both a pair of earbuds and the  big headphones I can say that it is fully worth the price. I chose this website because it is very easy to navigate and also very intirguing to the  viewers eye. I  like how on their  main  page the first thing someone on the website will see is the  new  products that they just produced or are promoting. Here they use cool images or even videos for people to learn more about the product. They also have drop  down menus under headphones and earphones so someone can easily see all the different models they make. They can learn more about each model by cliciking on it and scrolling through the facts on it.

            The second thing I notice as I inspected the website was that it was up to the latest version of HTML, HTML5. It had all the specs that needed to be on a html today to have it run properly. I also like how the website has a scrolling effect to it. This is when one scrolls down the website and either something moves or the page moves and an image appears and then disappears. One thing that I didn't like about the website was how they didn't have such a great helper when you had questions about a product. I feel like this was because Apple had bought the company so when you wanted to learn more about a  product or to buy a product. Because of this combination it can make it tricky to decide where to look at the Beats by Dre products. One  could either go to Apple.com or BeatsbyDre.com to learn more about the products. The navigation on the website is very straight forward and easy for anyone to use and get around the website. The Beats by Dre has also become a very iconic icon over the years and one that people recognize when they see it. On each page on the website it is in the top left corner and throughout each page at the bottom one can see the iconic logo. In the end, the only problem with the website was that there is a lot going on connected this one company with another since one compnay baught the other.

        <h2> <a href="https://www.apple.com/" target="blank">The Second Good Website! (Apple)</a></h2>
        <p>
            The second website that I looked at was Apple.com. Many people over  the  world know Apple and the products that they made. They are also known as being the first mover in the creation of the IPhone. This was a phone that would change the world forever. It was given a touch screen and could do more than earlier portable phones. Over the years Apple has devloped many more products that have been ahead of the times and ahead of other companies. But enough about their products, lets go back to their website. I really enjoy it and being someone who owns a lot of Apple devices I visit the website often just to see what new products they are unveiling or to get help if one of my devices is lagging out. One thing that I like a lot about the website is how fluent it is. It is very smooth and easy to go through. Each page for each product uses the scrolling effect which really makes the page interesting and interactive for the viewer. They also use very cool images that are taken with their own products so the buyer can see just how the product will actually perform. Their website is also up to snuff on the HTML code. It too like the Beats by Dre site, uses HTML5. They  defiently  seem to be a company that likes to update their website to the newer generations and make it super intriguing and grapping their attention from the moment they enter their website. A second thing that I liked about the website was how they use different texts when people scroll through a page, to point out the key points on it. They use bigger text sizes to talk more about main points about the product like a certain chip used in the product or like "A PHONE WITH THREE CAMERAS." They then go on to use smaller text to go more into detail under the main points. Another thing I really like about their website is if someone owns an Apple product they have people on hand who can help at almost any time of the day. With these people one can just kind of "text" back and forth with them or if it is a bigger issue they actually have the ability to work on ones personal phone or computer and show them the step by step process to fix their problem.

            However, there are things about the website that I did not like as much. One thing that I do not like about the website is that it can be a little tricky to find smaller things like chargers, or earphones instead of big things like computers or phones. They don't really have a seperate tab on the main tabs page for these things. In order for someone to get just a charger or just a pair of earphones they would have to click on either the "iphone or mac" tab and then go to accessories. It is not a big deal but it could be something that some people may miss and try and go for another website since they feel apple doesn't sell just a charger or earphones online. Another thing that I don't like about the website is that one can easily get lost in it. What I mean when I say this is that they do give a lot of information on each product and at times some people want to just buy the product and don't really want to read all the texh specs about it. This is an option but it is a good thing to look into anything before one buys it just so they know what they are buying. Since Apple gives so much info about each product though, it does get very time consuming for someone to do that. It would be easier for someone to probably just go and use the prooduct themselevs but that can also be tough if a physical store is far away from them. This can cause someone maybe spending upwards of 30 minutes to an hour to read about the product before they buy it so they know exactly what they are buying.

        <h3><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us" target="blank">The Bad Website :/ (Microsoft)</a></h3>
        <p>
            The website that I went to and did not like and thought was just really confusing and not well put together for me was the Microsoft website. This for me was a very confusing website for me to navigate through. There are some similariteis between this website and the Apple website, however, microsoft is covering a lot more technologies then Apple is and it causes their website to become very confusing. They do use the present version of HTMl, HTML5, but this still is just put together with so many parts and makes it hard to unravel. They have tabs at the top for the many products and services that they have but under each of those tabs is just more tabs under more tabs. For example, when you click on the Xbox tab on the main Microsoft page then it bring you to a whole new page that is all about xbox like buying the console along with games and other apps for it. Each of these is a new tab and just creates a lot of confusion. Another reason that I don't like this website is that it is really bland. I mean it does have cool photos of games, devices, and other products, but they dnt really use many colors in their website. They only seem to use the natural white background that you would see on any website. They don't really seem to try and enhance it by using the micrsoft signature colors like green, blue, red,or orange on any of their pages. Each page is just bland and not that all inviting.

            I do however like the photos that they use and some of the graphics they use are also very interesting. One example of this is when one clicks on the "surface" tab on the main page and it takes you to the surface computer page. Here they do use the scrolling effect a little but not a lot. It is mostly just used to bring the pictures of all their different surface computers together. Other than that they don't really seem to use any other graphics on any oof their pages and don't really make them stand out. I have come to the theory that since they have so many products and services that they don't feel the need to jazz up their pages because they were burned out from making all the different pages and connecting them all together. The designer for the website had a lot to do all ready and hopefully later on they will change the layout of the website and some pizzazz to it.
