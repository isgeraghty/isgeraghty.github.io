<h1>Ivan's Web Hosting Review</h1>
<h2><a href="http://www.godaddy.com" target="_new">GoDaddy</a></h2>
 <p>Why I chose this host as My #1:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>They seem to be fairly cheap</li>
            <li>Ex: economy plan for web hosting starts at $5.99/month, and the highest one would pay is $19.99/month. <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/hosting/web-hosting" target="_new"> Web Hosting Plans </a></li>
        <li>They have 24/7 support for people building  websites, wherever and whenever one may need them. <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/websites" target="_new"> GoDaddy Websites</a></li>
        <li>They also have many different designs for one to choose from when starting up on their website. <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/website-templates" target="new"> GoDaddy Templates</a></li>
        <li>Another thing I like is that they give the customer a 1 month free trial on their website builder, and even when the customer has the pay the rates are still low starting at $10-$25/month. <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/websites/website-builder/plans-and-pricing" target="_new"> Website Plans</a></li>
        <li>GoDaddy also gives buisness deals such as <b><u>BUISNESS PREMIUM</u></b> which gives the user a professional email and many other office essentials for $14.99/month. (One could also just get a buisness email for $9.99/month.) <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/email" target="_new"> Buisness Deal</a></li>
