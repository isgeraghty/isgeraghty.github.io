        <p>To be a good goalkeeper one needs to have the strength both physically and mentally. During a game one has to get behind balls that are coming at fast speeds and get their hands behind it, but also not get injured in the process. They also need to be mentally strong. They need to be able to not "fall" when a goal goes past them. If they lose their heads then the rest of the team may lose their heads as well. The goalkeeper is one of the most forcefull people on the soccer field and in my experience when I fall or get annoyed then the rest of the team gets annoyed. The same can be true the other way around too. If the team gets annoyed that can correlate to the goalkeeper. If this happens the goalkeeper can't fall with the rest of the team. Instead he needs to keep his head and try to pick his team up.</p>

            Goalkeeping also takes playing with good gear, I know that may not make sense but hear me out. It builds off that idea of deel good, look god, play good. If you have bad materials then how can u expect to perform at your highest capability. This is in the gloves that ones uses as a goalkeeper and also the cleats. This is all about how they feel on one's hands and feet. For me I go Adidas all the way because it is long lasting and the cleats are easy to break in. However, this is different for everyone, some people like Nike or Puma and that's fine. You just need to find what works well and also feels good on you.

        <p>Here is just a quick list of items that are good for one starting off as a goalkeeper (also for anyone just playing soccer in general).</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cleats</li>
                <li>Shin guards</li>
                <li>Goalkeeper Gloves</li>
                <li>soccer socks</li>
                <li>Goalkeeper jersey (a color different from their own team and others)</li>
                <li>a undershirt for a little added protection/padding</li>
                <li>specialty sport glasses (if needed)</li>
            </ul>
