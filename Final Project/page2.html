            Goalkeeping is the position in soccer where one player stands in the goal and stops the oteher team from scoring. Of course this seems hard to a lot of people, but in reality the goalkeeper has it easy because he is the only one who is told he HAS to use his hands.

            However, the goalkeeper, more than other players on the field, takes the most shots to the face or the entire body. The goalkeeper really has to be prepared every practice and game to put his body on the line. But there are also ways  that coaches go over ways that a goalkeeper can put his body on the line but not get a sever injury.

            Goalkeeping is one of the most important positions on the field because what a goalkeeper does during a game can cause or prevent a goal. A goalkeeper has to be both mentally and physically ready to enter a match. The mentallity of a goalkeeper can change the mentality of the entire team. For example, if a goalkeeper looses his head, then that can cause the rest of the team to lose their heads as well.
