        <p>Many people when looking at Goalkeeping are not huge fans of it. Those who observe it feel that it is a really rough position and they are not wrong. The position is very taxing on a persons body and also on their mind. The position causes the person playing it to use their mind and strength a lot. The goalkeeper not only has to think about what he des during the game but he also has to control the rest of the team. For example, on a corner the goalkeeper has to position everyone where they need to be or where he wants them to be.</p>
        
        <p>
            From a personal perspective it is also very dangerous. A goalkeeper is always diving in at peoples feet and there is always a chance of injury. A goalkeeper can use every part of his body to make sure a ball doesn't go into the goal for a score. From  my own experience I have taken many cleats and balls to the face, mid section, and lower regions. However, after a while one does get used to it and the pain is not as significant as the first time. Now when I get kicked there I still feel it but it doesn't have the lasting effect that it did when I first got kicked there.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the professional level injuries are more common mostly since the effort given is higher and therefore the chance of injury is higher. Even this year one goalkeeper in the premier league came out to block a shot and got to it but his hand bent the wrong way. This caused him to be out for the remainder of the season.
