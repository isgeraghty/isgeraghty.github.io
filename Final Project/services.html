        <h2>Adult League and Where to find them.</h2>
        <p>The Bozeman Adult Soccer League is one of the most competitive in all of Montana. They travel all over Montana to play game and take practice and games very seriously. They are a good option for adults who truly love the sport and want to take it seriously, along with others who feel the same about the sport. One can follow their facebook page to see when they are holding tryouts, where they are playing, and how to get in contact with them (including their website).</p>

        <h3>Helena Youth Soccer Association</h3>
        <p>This organization is one that I have worked with while being on the Carroll Men's soccer team and they are a great place for parents looking for teams that their children can play on. They have many teams from all age groups and skill levels. They are also easy to find with most of their teams practicing at the field close to the Helena Airport so they are easy to find! One can follow their facebook page to see when they are holding tryouts, where they are playing, and how to get in contact with them. You can also contact me to get in touch with Phil who is the head of the Association.</p>
